Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of MySQL Connectors.\n- Dependency `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:2.2.4.RELEASE` has **1** known CVEs need to be fixed:\n  - [CVE-2022-22965](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36p3-wjmg-h94x): Remote Code Execution in Spring Framework\n    - **Severity**: **CRITICAL**\n    - **Details**: Spring Framework prior to versions 5.2.20 and 5.3.18 contains a remote code execution vulnerability known as `Spring4Shell`. \n      \n      ## Impact\n      \n      A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n      \n      These are the prerequisites for the exploit:\n      - JDK 9 or higher\n      - Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container\n      - Packaged as WAR\n      - `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency\n      \n      ## Patches\n      \n      - Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE)\n      - Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)\n      \n      ## Workarounds\n      \n      For those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.\n      \n      To apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux).",

  - [CVE-2023-22102](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m6vm-37g8-gqvh): MySQL Connectors takeover vulnerability
    - **Severity**: **HIGH**
    - **Details**: Vulnerability in the MySQL Connectors product of Oracle MySQL (component: Connector/J). Supported versions that are affected are 8.1.0 and prior. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Connectors. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in MySQL Connectors, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of MySQL Connectors.

  - [CVE-2022-22965](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36p3-wjmg-h94x): Remote Code Execution in Spring Framework
    - **Severity**: **CRITICAL**
    - **Details**: Spring Framework prior to versions 5.2.20 and 5.3.18 contains a remote code execution vulnerability known as `Spring4Shell`. 
      
      ## Impact
      
      A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.
      
      These are the prerequisites for the exploit:
      - JDK 9 or higher
      - Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container
      - Packaged as WAR
      - `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency
      
      ## Patches
      
      - Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE)
      - Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)
      
      ## Workarounds
      
      For those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.
      
      To apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux).}).
